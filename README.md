# Notecat

This is an app that was made by me to learn TypeScript. The Vanilla TS base was written by me, while the Svelte 5 migration has been **vibe-coded** - since the initial goal is to make an app that feels decent to use, rather than spending time learning web development as a guy who wants to learn more Rust instead.
